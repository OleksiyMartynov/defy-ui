            Filter our the noise and find answers to today&apos;s hot debate

        Everyone loves Bitcoin! But due to its monetary policy the base-layer is
        not optimal for micro-payments. You would&apos;nt go to a central bank
        to pay for a coffee, would you? So we chose to use Lightning Network, a
        second layer network on top of Bitcoin, in order to leverage it&apos;s
        properties:
        <ul>
          <li>Near-zero percent transaction fees</li>
          <li>Near-zero second transaction times</li>
          <li>Easy and simple to use wallets</li>
          <li>Options for anonymous transactions</li>

        We would strongly recommend running your own Bitcoin and Lightning
        nodes. But we understand that some of us dont have the technical
        resources to set up our own nodes, or just lazy, in that case please

        A debate is a topic that a user wants to find an answer too. A topic
        will have two opposing sides (pro/con, for/against). Any user can create
        a debate by providing a name, description, and locking up a stake that
        will initially signal the importance of the debate. Once the debate is
        inactive for 24 hours the debate will be marked as closed and the
        creator will receive their initially locked up stake.

      <span>
        For any ongoing debate users can vote for a side by locking up a any
        amount. Votes on the winning majority stake side will receive the
        initial stake and a weighted fraction of the losing side stake. Votes on
        the losing minority side will lose all of their stake to the winning
        side.

      <span>
        Evidence is a link to information that backs up that specific side of
        the debate. This can be news article, research paper, youtube video, or
        even a facebook post. Same rules apply to evidence and votes. For any
        ongoing debate users can provide evidence for a debate side by locking
        up a any amount. Evidence on the winning majority stake side will
        receive the initial stake and a weighted fraction of the losing side
        stake. Evidence on the losing minority side will lose all of their stake
        to the winning side.

        You win a weighted fraction of the minority side&apos;s stake. The
        fraction size is determined on the size of your stake compared to the
        total winning side&apos;s stake. To help your side of the debate win,
        user should provide good evidence in favour of the side.
